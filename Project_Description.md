The project is based on Facial Emotion Analysis using DeepFace and other libraries or packages.

Image obtaining, Face Detection and Facial Emotion Analysis codes are in the "Deep Model Code.py" file.

"api.py" code file contains the same codes, but additionally, this file can be published with '/analyze' route at the end of the API. You can use various API share packages or tools to enable your code to accept requests. My personal preference is the ngrok tool.

'test_analyze_image.py' code file contains testing codes for the same code block. Within, unittest framework of Python is used and all possible cases(regarding Error Exception) are tested. You can directly compile this code file.

All explanations for specific code blocks are included in the code files.

Other files or folders are required files, some are generated by the code files automatically. Do not remove them in order the code files to work properly.

I hope this project provides a basic and fundamental to advanced FER projects.
